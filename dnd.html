                        <p>Wylliam Brightforge is a quirky Half-Elf who spends most of his time in workshops tinkering and making devices. His father was high up on the magic defense council, which introduced Wyll to crafting weapons and armament, his true passion. At 18, Wyll joined the Magic Defense Force but was quickly discharged for not fitting in and being too weird around the other cadets. Embarrassed, his father disowned him, leading Wyll to steal a workshop portal and run away into the unknown.</p>

                        <h2 class="left-justify">Family</h2>
                        <p>Wyll comes from a prominent family known for their contributions to magical defense. His father, Eldrin Brightforge, is a respected figure on the magic defense council, and his mother, Lyria Brightforge, is a skilled healer. Wyll has a cousin, Lysander Brightforge, a pure high elf who is the same age as Wyll and shares his interest in magical crafting.</p>

                        <h2 class="left-justify">Goals</h2>
                        <p>Wyll's goal in his current D&D campaign is to make a bullet. He plans to make the primer of his bullet a fire infusion and use a mithril anvil charged with mana to strike the infused primer, sparking the enchantment and causing the explosion. He also plans to infuse bullets with other magical infusions, such as fire/incendiary rounds, Hunter's Mark for homing bullets, and freezing rounds.</p>

                <h2 class="left-justify">Backstory</h2>
                <p>Wyll grew up in a household where magic and crafting were a part of daily life. From a young age, he showed a keen interest in inventing and creating devices. Despite his passion and skills, Wyll's eccentric personality often put him at odds with others. This eventually led to his discharge from the Magic Defense Force, a move that deeply embarrassed his father and led to Wyll's estrangement from his family.</p>
                <p>Determined to prove his worth, Wyll stole a workshop portal and set out on his own. His journey has been one of self-discovery, filled with numerous inventions and magical experiments. Despite the challenges, Wyll remains hopeful that one day he will reconcile with his family and demonstrate the value of his unique talents.</p>

                <p>Wyll carries an Artificer's Journal in a leather pouch on his hip, similar to a drop leg carry for a firearm or grimoire. He also wears an overcoat with the Cloak of Protection sewn on the outside and the Cloak of Elvenkind sewn on the inside lining, allowing him to reverse the coat to switch between different effects.</p>

                <p>Wyll is developing the MDR1 (Magic Defense Rifle 1), a magical rifle based on the M1 Garand design. The rifle features a wooden body, a metal barrel, a mithril firing mechanism, loads from the top, and is semi-automatic. The internal magazine holds 8 rounds plus 1 in the chamber and reloads with stripper clips. It also has magic circles for iron sights.</p>
